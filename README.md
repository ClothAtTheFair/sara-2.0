# SARA - 2.0

Smart Automated Robotic Assistant or SARA is a custom multi-nodal open source assistant created with the goal of surpassing JARVIS.
Why is it SARA 2.0? An earlier version of SARA was created but the scope was not correct and the it was easier to take lessons learned from the 
original and create a new SARA. 

## Current Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
